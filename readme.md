> From your "first test request" to your "first production transaction" and beyond

This is a guide to support developers that are integrating with Hash API for the first time. The initial part of this document is a step-by-step guide on the requests you need to make in order for your first test transaction to work. The second part will better illustrate all entities that we created in this guide and how they corelate with each other in Hash's environment.

The code part of this guide was writen in JS for illustration. For more information on the code there is a section below the guide [about the code in this repository](#about-the-code-in-this-repository)

# Step-by-step request guide to your first transaction 

If you are reading this document you might have received an email with your initial credentials, Hash's API Docs link and your API test key. You are a company in Hash's API now, and your api key is directly tied to your company.

An API key will be required for every request in our API and it should be sent in the header. To see how that happens at the code level check out the [request module](./src/request.js) for this repository; the function "makeRequest" (line 3) builds the correct header using a Hash API Key.

## Create company

Your company is the parent of all the companies you create in our API, and in order to make a transaction your first step is to create a company that will be responsible for this transaction.

When succesfull, the request below will return an object that represents the new company created. **For all the other next steps, use the API key that is returned inside the company object from this request's response, this is how we link all other entities to this company**

The `createCompany` used is this file: [mock-data/create-company.json](./src/mock-data/create-company.json)

The `parentCompanyApiKey` used is your API key

```js
const childCompany = await post(
  'https://api.hash.com.br/children/companies',
  createCompany,
  parentCompanyApiKey
)

childCompanyApiKey = childCompany.hash_key
childCompanyId = childCompany.id
```

_API Docs source: https://docs.hash.com.br/reference#create-merchant_

## Create affiliation

After creating a company you have to create an affiliation which will contain the provider used to register transactions. To do this, please create the following request:

The `createAffiliation` used is this file: [mock-data/create-affiliation.json](./src/mock-data/create-affiliation.json)

```js
const company = await post(
  'https://api.hash.com.br/affiliations',
  createAffiliation,
  childCompanyApiKey
)
```
_source: ["Create affiliation" in index.test.js](https://github.com/hashlab/use-hash/blob/main/src/index.test.js#L30-L43)_

_API Docs source: https://docs.hash.com.br/reference#create-affiliations_

## Configure fee rule

After creating a company and an affiliation you have to register the fee rule for the company created. To do this, please create the following request:

The `createFeeRule` used is this file: [mock-data/create-fee-rule.json](./src/mock-data/create-fee-rule.json)

```js
const feeRule = await post(
  `https://api.hash.com.br/children/${childCompanyId}/fee_rule`
  createFeeRule,
  parentCompanyApiKey
)
```
_source: ["Create fee rule" in index.test.js](https://github.com/hashlab/use-hash/blob/main/src/index.test.js#L46-L57)_

_API Docs source: https://docs.hash.com.br/reference#create-fee-rule_

## Register Hardware

The last step before being able to register transaction is to register a hardware (for example, a POS). Be sure to alter the data to match your hardware model. The serial number can be found on a barcode sticker attached to the hardware box, the model and provider can be found on the hardware itself. To register a hardware, please create the following request:

The `registerHardware` used is this file: [mock-data/register-hardware.json](./src/mock-data/register-hardware.json)

```js
const hardware = await post(
  `https://api.hash.com.br/children/${childCompanyId}/hardwares`,
  registerHardware,
  parentCompanyApiKey
)
```
_source: ["Register hardware" in index.test.js](https://github.com/hashlab/use-hash/blob/main/src/index.test.js#L60-L75)_

_API Docs source: https://docs.hash.com.br/reference#register-a-hardware_

## Register Transaction 

With everything properly registered, you should now be able to create a transaction with your hardware. To do that, please turn it on, input the merchant document number (which activates the harware), and you should be able to swipe a card and make a test transaction.

# Beyond the first transaction

## View all transactions for a company

Now that you made a transaction you should be able to see it in Hash's API. To view all transactions for a company, you may utilize the request below. Make sure you are using the hash_key of the company for which you wish to list the transactions.

```js
const response = await get(
  'https://api.hash.com.br/children/transactions?count=10&page=1',
  {}, // empty body because it's a GET request, parameters are above in URL.
  childCompanyApiKey
)
```

_API Docs source: https://docs.hash.com.br/reference#get-all-transactions_

## View financial calendar for a company 

There is an entity called "payables", which represents an amount of money to be paid to someone. You may list a company's payables to obtain its financial calendar (i.e., how much should a company receive and when). To do so, you may utilize the request below.

```js
const response = await get(
  `https://api.hash.com.br/payables/${childCompanyId}`,
  {},
  childCompanyApiKey
)
```

_source: ["View financial calendar for a company" in index.test.js](https://github.com/hashlab/use-hash/blob/main/src/index.test.js#L100-L108)_


## Set anticipation configuration

Anticipation is the act of changing a payable's date to an earlier date, thus making a company receive its money earlier. Please note that this process is typically not free of charge. You can schedule periodic anticipations or you can choose to create spot anticipations. By default, anticipations are automatic and the interval is set to 1 business day â€” that is, the payable's dates are set to the next business day. However, you can set your own default for the companies you create by updating them through the route below.

```js
const response = await put(
  'https://api.hash.com.br/anticipation',
  {
    "anticipation_type": "automatic", // or "spot" for disabling automatic anticipation
    "anticipation_days_interval": 7, // min 1, max 30. If above is "spot" this is ignored.
  },
  childCompanyApiKey
)
```

The API key used will determine the company to be updated.

## Simulating spot anticipation

Before creating an anticipation, you should simulate one, as anticipations are not free of charge.

First, make sure that the company has its anticipation configuration set to "spot" insted of "automatic". To do so, you may utilize the request below.

```js
const response = await put(
  'https://api.hash.com.br/anticipation',
  {
    "anticipation_type": "spot"
  },
  childCompanyApiKey
)
```

With the company correctly set to spot anticipation, you may simulate an anticipation with the request below.

```js
const response = await post(
  'https://api.hash.com.br/anticipation/simulation',
  {
    "anticipate_to": "2019-05-13",
    "payables_priority": "start",
    "anticipate_all": false,
    "anticipation_type": "per_month",
    "anticipation_fee": 3,
    "requested_amount": 500
  },
  childCompanyApiKey
)
```

_API Docs source: https://docs.hash.com.br/reference#sobre-a-spot-anticipation_

## Executing spot anticipation

To execute a spot anticipation you may use the request below.

```js
const response = await post(
  'https://api.hash.com.br/anticipation',
  {
    "anticipate_to": "2019-05-13",
    "payables_priority": "start",
    "anticipate_all": false,
    "anticipation_type": "per_month",
    "anticipation_fee": 3,
    "requested_amount": 500
  },
  childCompanyApiKey
)
```

# About the code in this repository

You may clone this repository and you may also run the code to test request yourself:

1) Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/);
2) Clone this repository;
3) Run `npm install` to install dependencies;
4) Add your hash_keys and IDs;
5) Run `npm test` to run all tests.

Note in respect to Step 4: You will have to make alterations in some lines for the tests in [**index.test.js**](./src/inde.test.js) to work. Listed below are some of the lines that you will have to change. It is wise to check all fields in the mock data and change them to your testing needs:

* [**line 4**](https://github.com/hashlab/use-hash/blob/main/src/index.test.js#L4): Add the hash_key of your parent company

    * If you already ran the test once you have to change the document number on line 16 in order to create a new 
company. The document number is an unique identifier for our API.

* [**line 14**](https://github.com/hashlab/use-hash/blob/main/src/index.test.js#L14): Will work only once since you can only create one company for each document number. Change it to create another company.

* [**line 15**](https://github.com/hashlab/use-hash/blob/main/src/index.test.js#L15): Add a valid mcc (your valid MCCs are sent together with your hash_key)

* [**line 34**](https://github.com/hashlab/use-hash/blob/main/src/index.test.js#L34): Add a valid internal_merchant_id (your valid internal_merchant_id's are sent together with your API Key)

* [**lines 64 to 66**](https://github.com/hashlab/use-hash/blob/main/src/index.test.js#L64-L66): Add your hardware information
